# Autopilot Vehicle Braking System 🚗🛑

## Overview

This project, **"Design and Development of Autopilot Vehicle Braking System"**, is a B.Tech major project submitted to the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune, in the academic year 2023–2024. The system leverages **IoT**, **Arduino**, and **sensor-based control** to autonomously apply brakes and prevent vehicle collisions. It integrates sensors like ultrasonic modules and actuators such as servo motors to demonstrate real-time obstacle detection and braking response.

## Objective

To design and prototype a braking system that can autonomously detect obstacles in a vehicle’s path and activate braking mechanisms without human intervention—thereby enhancing road safety and reducing accidents caused by delayed driver reaction.

## Features

- ⚙️ Real-time **distance measurement** using ultrasonic sensors  
- 🧠 Intelligent **braking decisions** through Arduino-based control  
- 🔁 Servo motor control to simulate **brake actuation**  
- ⚡ Adaptive and predictive braking logic  
- 📦 Easily integrable with existing vehicle systems  
- 🧪 Prototyped and tested with practical scenarios
